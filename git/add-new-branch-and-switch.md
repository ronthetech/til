# How to Add a New Branch and Switch to It

---

You can create a new branch using `git branch`:

```bash
$ git branch <new-branch>
```

You can switch to the new branch using `git switch`:

```bash
$ git switch <new-branch>
```

You can do both steps in one by using the `-c` flag with `git switch` and passing in the name of the new branch you want to create:

```bash
$ git switch -c <new-branch>
```
