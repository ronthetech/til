# How to Add a New Branch and Checkout

---

You can create a new branch using `git branch`:

```bash
$ git branch <new-branch>
```

You can switch to the new branch using `git checkout`:

```bash
$ git checkout <new-branch>
```

You can do both steps in one by using the `-b` flag with `git checkout` and passing in the name of the new branch you want to create:

```bash
$ git checkout -b <new-branch>
```
