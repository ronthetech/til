# How to Push to a Repository

---

You can push your commits into a repository by using the `git push` command and specifying the remote and branch as options. The `repository` is the URL or name of a remote, the destination for the push, and the `src` is the name of the branch you want to push.

```bash
$ git push <repository> <src>
$ git push origin main
$ git push -u origin main
```
