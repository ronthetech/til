# How to Install Scoop

---

Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows machines.

```shell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# ^Optional: Needed to run a remote script the first time

> irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

You can verify the installation was successful and view instructions for `scoop` by running the command:

```shell
> scoop help
```
