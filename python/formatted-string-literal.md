# How to Use Formatted String Literals

---

## `f-strings`

You can include the values of an expression inside a string with Python formatted string literals, also known as `f-strings`. You have to prefix the string with `f` or `F` and write expressions like `{ expression }`.

```python
name = 'Ron'
print(f'Hi {name}! How Are You?')  
#  Hi Ron! How Are You?
```
