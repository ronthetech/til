# How to Use the Filter Method

---

In JavaScript, the `.filter()` method allows you to create a new array by returning the elements of a given array that pass a test implemented by the function you provide.

```js
const years = [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]

const even = years.filter((year) => year % 2 === 0)

console.log(even)

```
