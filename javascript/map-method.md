# How to Use the Map Method

---

In JavaScript, the `.map()` method allows you to create a new array by returning the results of calling a function that you provide on every element in a given array.

```js
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
const squared = numbers.map((num)=> num * num)
console.log(squared)

```
